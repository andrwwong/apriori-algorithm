# Apriori Algorithm

Apriori Algorithm is a data mining algorithm that creates association rules by mining frequent itemsets. A bottom-up approach
is used where frequent item sets are expanded one item at a time. The program runs until all frequent item sets have been exhausted. Run with VisualStudio 2013.

Below is a list of basic terminology to better understand the program:
- Frequent Item: an item whose support is greater than or equal to the minimum support threshold
- Item: a number or group of numbers, e.g. {1} or {1, 2, 5}
- Itemset: A group of items.
- Minimum Support Threshold: An arbritary number the support must equal or surpass for the item to be called frequent.
- Support: The number of times an item appears in the data set.
